# Slideshow
View Imgur media as slideshows in a clean, fast client. Also allows you to view all the images in a Reddit thread's comments as an album!
## Installation
1. Install GreaseMonkey or Tampermonkey depending on your browser. Click [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome, and [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/p/tampermonkey/9nblggh5162s?rtc=1) for Microsoft Edge.
2. Install the [script on GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/26477-slideshow).
3. If you get a page asking whether to allow cross-domain resource, click "Always allow". This page pops up because we're getting information from another website.
## Usage
- Load up any Imgur album or image and the program runs automatically.
- To view the images in the comments of a Reddit thread, press the "Slideshow" button beneath the original post.
